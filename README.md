## Flutter Programming Task

In order to be considered for the SW position, you must complete the following steps. 

*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours at the most.*



### Prerequisites

- Please note that this will require some basic [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) knowledge. 
- If you don't know Dart, [take a few minutes to learn the basics](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour) and if you don't know Flutter [learn about it here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/tutorial).  
- Follow the steps to install Flutter and an IDE of your choosing [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/).

## Task

1. Fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend)
2. Create a `source` folder to contain your code. 
3. In the `source` directory, please create a Flutter app that accomplishes the following:
	- Connect to the [Github API](http://developer.github.com/)
	- Find the [flutter/flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) repository
	- Find the most recent commits (choose at least 25 or more of the commits)
	- Create a `List` widget that displays the recent commits by author in a view. Each list item should include
        - message title, 
        - user name,
        - avatar image,
        - git sha
	- [Click here](screen1.jpg) for a screenshot mock up of what Screen 1 could look like.
    - Create a second detail screen, when a commit item in the list is tapped, that shows the message title and full message body.
    - [Click here](screen2.jpg) for a screenshot mock up of what Screen 2 could look like.
	- Include a screenshot for each screen of your application
4. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
5. Send us a pull request, we will review your code and get back to you
